This repo contains the code for the working prototype and soon to be MVP of the Justice40 Climate, Environmental, and Economic Justice Screeing Tool. The Justice40 initiative and screening tool were announced in an [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/) in January 2021, with the goal to launch an MVP of the tool by July 27, 2021. This tool will include interactive maps and an initial draft scorecard by which federal agencies can identify historically overburdened and underserved communities for benefits in their programs.

The Justice40 team is taking a community-first and open source approach to the product development of this tool. We encourage contributions in the form of discussion on issues in this repo and pull requests of documentation and code. Please see the [Contributing](#Contributing) section for more information.
