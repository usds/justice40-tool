## Background

The Justice40 initiative and CEJST were announced in the [Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/) in January 2021. The CEJST includes interactive maps and federal agencies can use the tool to prioritize verburdened and underserved communities for benefits in their covered programs.


## Core Team

The initial versions of this tool were developed by [US Digital Service](https://www.usds.gov) in partnership with the [Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ceq/).
