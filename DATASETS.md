# Justice40 Datasets

This page contains web links to the datasets that are uploaded as part of our data pipeline, if you want to access them directly.

For now, we have two datasets:

- Census data, generated by the [Generate Census Github Action](https://github.com/usds/justice40-tool/blob/main/.github/workflows/generate-census.yml): https://justice40-data.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/data-sources/census.zip
- Score data, generated by the [Generate Score Github Action](https://github.com/usds/justice40-tool/blob/main/.github/workflows/generate-score.yml): https://justice40-data.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/data-pipeline/data/score/csv/full/usa.csv
