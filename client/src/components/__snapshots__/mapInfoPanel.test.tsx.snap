      A census tract is generally between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. 
      Census tracts are small, relatively permanent subdivisions of a county defined by the 
      U.S. Census Bureau and usually cover a contiguous area. Census tract geographical boundaries 
      are determined by the U.S. Census Bureau once every ten years. This tool utilizes the census 
      tract boundaries from 2010.
