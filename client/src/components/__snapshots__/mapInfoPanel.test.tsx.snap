      The tool uses census tracts

      Communities that are disadvantaged live in tracts that experience burdens. These tracts are highlighted in a blueish gray color

      The tool uses percentiles
    
        <img
          alt="
      An icon that a bell curve or gaussian distribution

          src="test-file-stub"

        />
        
      , or a simple yes/no to indicate how much burden the communities are experiencing in each tract. 
    
      </p>
      <p

    The tool also uses thresholds. If the tract meets or exceeds the threshold of any climate, environmental, or other burden 
        <strong>
          AND
        </strong>
         it meets the threshold for the associated socioeconomic burden, then communites in the tract are considered disadvantaged.
