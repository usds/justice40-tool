      The goal of this tool is to identify communities that are marginalized, underserved and overburdened
      by pollution. These communities will be at or above the combined threshold for one of more of 
      eight categories of criteria.

      The tool uses census tracts that represent about 4000 people and are the smallest unit of geography
      at which consistent data is currently available

      The tool ranks each census tract using percentiles which show how much burden each tract has relative to
      all the other tracts.
