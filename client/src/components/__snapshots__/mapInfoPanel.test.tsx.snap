      A census tract is generally between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. 
      Census tracts are small, relatively permanent subdivisions of a county defined by the 
      U.S. Census Bureau and usually cover a contiguous area. The census tract level represents the 
      smallest geographical unity that can be presented in a statistically sound manner, given the 
      datasets that are being used.
