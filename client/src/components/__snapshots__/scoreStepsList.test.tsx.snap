        The methodology for identifying communities of focus is calculated at the census block group level. Census block geographical boundaries are determined by the U.S. Census Bureau once every ten years. This tool utilizes the census block boundaries from 2010.

        The following describes the process for identifying communities of focus.

        The methodology includes the following inputs that are equally weighted.

        If a census block group is in a metropolitan area, this value is the median income of the census block group calculated as a percent of the metropolitan area’s median income.
      </p>

        If a census block group is not in a metropolitan area, this value is the median income of the census block group calculated as a percent of the state’s median income.

      <h4>
        Percent of households below or at 100% of the federal poverty line

      . This federal poverty line is calculated 
    based on the composition of each household (e.g., based on household size), but it does not vary geographically.
