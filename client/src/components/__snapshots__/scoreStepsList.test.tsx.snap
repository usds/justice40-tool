        The methodology for identifying communities of focus is calculated at the census block group level. Census block geographical boundaries are determined by the U.S. Census Bureau once every ten years. This tool utilizes the census block boundaries from 2010.

        If a census block group is in a metropolitan area, this value is the median income of the census block group calculated as a percent of the metropolitan area’s median income.

        If a census block group is not in a metropolitan area, this value is the median income of the census block group calculated as a percent of the state’s median income.

        This is the percent of households in a state with a household income below 200% of the federal poverty line. This federal poverty line is calculated based on the composition of each household (e.g., based on household size), but it does not vary geographically.
