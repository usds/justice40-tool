          Categories of Burdens
        </h2>
        <p>
          
      The tool uses datasets as indicators of burdens. The burdens are organized into categories. A community is highlighted as disadvantaged on the CEJST map if it is in a census tract that is (1) at or above the threshold for one or more environmental, climate, or other burdens, and (2) at or
      above the threshold for an associated socioeconomic burden.
    
        </p>
        <p>
          
      In addition, a census tract that is completely surrounded by disadvantaged communities and is at or above the 50% percentile for low income is also considered disadvantaged.

      census boundaries.
