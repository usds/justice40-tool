    Economic loss rate to the population in fatalities and injuries resulting from the natural
    hazards each year. This rate is monetized into a population equivalence using a value of
    statistical life (VSL) approach where each fatality or ten injuries is treated as $7.6 million
    of economic loss. This was determined by inflating the 2015 VSL of $6.9 million to 2020 dollars
    using the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index Inflation Calculator.
