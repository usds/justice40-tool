      The datasets used in the current version of the tool come from a variety of sources and were 
      selected based on relevance, availability, and quality. The datasets seek to identify a range of 
      human health, environmental, climate-related, and other impacts on communities.

        coastal flooding, cold wave, drought, hail, heat wave, hurricane, ice storm, landslide, 
        riverine flooding, strong wind, tornado, wildfire, and winter weather. Population loss is defined 
        as the Spatial Hazard Events and Losses or National Centers for Environmental Information’s 
        (NCEI) reported number of fatalities and injuries caused by the hazard occurrence. To 
        combine fatalities and injuries for the computation of population loss value, an injury is counted 
        as one-tenth (1/10) of a fatality. The NCEI Storm Events Database classifies injuries and fatalities 
        as direct or indirect. Both direct and indirect injuries and fatalities are counted as population 
        loss. This total number of injuries and fatalities is then divided by the population in the 
        census tract to get a per-capita rate of population risk.
