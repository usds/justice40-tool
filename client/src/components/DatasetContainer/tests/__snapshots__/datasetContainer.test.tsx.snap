        Expected fatalities and injuries due to fourteen types of natural hazards each year. These hazards have some link to climate change. They are: avalanche, coastal flooding, cold wave, drought, hail, heat wave, hurricane, ice storm, landslide, riverine flooding, strong wind, tornado, wildfire, and winter weather. Population loss is defined by the Spatial Hazard Events and Losses and National Centers for Environmental Information’s (NCEI). It reports the number of fatalities and injuries caused by the hazard. An injury is counted as one-tenth (1/10) of a fatality. The NCEI Storm Events Database classifies both direct and indirect injuries. Both types are counted as population loss. The total number is divided by the population in the census tract to get the rate of population loss.

        A high precision, climate-adjusted model that projects future flood risk for properties in the future. The dataset calculates how many properties are at risk of floods occurring in the next thirty years from tides, rain, riverine and storm surges, or a 26% risk total over the 30-year time horizon. The risk is defined as an annualized 1% chance. The tool calculates tract-level risk as the share of properties meeting the risk threshold. The risk does not include property value.
