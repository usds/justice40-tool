              <div>
                
      Rate relative to the population in fatalities and injuries due to natural hazards each year. 
      Fourteen natural hazards that have some link to climate change include: avalanche, coastal 
      flooding, cold wave, drought, hail, heat wave, hurricane, ice storm, landslide, riverine 
      flooding, strong wind, tornado, wildfire, and winter weather.
      Population loss is defined as the Spatial Hazard Events and Losses or National Centers 
      for Environmental Information’s (NCEI) reported number of fatalities and injuries caused by the 
      hazard occurrence. To combine fatalities and injuries for the computation of population loss value, 
      an injury is counted as one-tenth (1/10) of a fatality. The NCEI Storm Events Database 
      classifies injuries and fatalities as direct or indirect. Both direct and indirect injuries 
      and fatalities are counted as population loss. This total number of injuries and fatalities 
      is then divided by the population in the census tract to get a per-capita rate of population risk.

      0th percentile, and the tract with the lowest median income relative to area median income
