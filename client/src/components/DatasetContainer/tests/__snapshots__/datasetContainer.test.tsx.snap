              <div>
                
    Rate relative to the population in fatalities and injuries resulting from natural hazards each 
    year. Population loss is defined as the Spatial Hazard Events and Losses or National Centers 
    for Environmental Information’s reported number of fatalities and injuries caused by the 
    hazard occurrence. To combine fatalities and injuries for the computation of population loss value, 
    an injury is counted as one-tenth (1/10) of a fatality. The NCEI Storm Events Database 
    classifies injuries and fatalities as direct or indirect. Both direct and indirect injuries 
    and fatalities are counted as population loss. This total number of injuries and fatalities is 
    then divided by the population in the census tract to get a per-capita rate of population risk.
