              <div>
                
        Rate relative to the population in fatalities and injuries due to natural hazards each year. 
        Fourteen natural hazards that have some link to climate change include: avalanche, coastal 
        flooding, cold wave, drought, hail, heat wave, hurricane, ice storm, landslide, riverine 
        flooding, strong wind, tornado, wildfire, and winter weather.
        Population loss is defined as the Spatial Hazard Events and Losses or National Centers 
        for Environmental Information’s (NCEI) reported number of fatalities and injuries caused by the 
        hazard occurrence. To combine fatalities and injuries for the computation of population loss value, 
        an injury is counted as one-tenth (1/10) of a fatality. The NCEI Storm Events Database 
        classifies injuries and fatalities as direct or indirect. Both direct and indirect injuries 
        and fatalities are counted as population loss. This total number of injuries and fatalities 
        is then divided by the population in the census tract to get a per-capita rate of population risk.

        Average number of years of life a person who has attained a given age can expect to live.

          Unlike most of the other datasets, high values of this indicator indicate low burdens. 
          For percentile calculations, the percentile is calculated in reverse order, so that the tract with 
          the highest median income relative to area median income (lowest burden on this measure) is at the 
          0th percentile, and the tract with the lowest median income relative to area median income 
          (highest burden on this measure) is at the 100th percentile.
