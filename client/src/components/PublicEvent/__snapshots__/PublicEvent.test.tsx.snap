        The White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), in partnership with the U.S. Digital 
        Service, is hosting a series of 'Training Webinars' for users of the Climate and Economic 
        Justice Screening Tool. These webinars are an opportunity for members of the public to learn how to

        provide technical support and address issues related to accessing and using the tool.
