The purpose of the tool is to help Federal agencies identify disadvantaged communities and provide socioeconomic, environmental, and climate information and data to inform decisions that may affect these communities. The tool identifies disadvantaged communities as communities of focus through publicly available, nationally consistent, high-quality data.",
	"about.page.sub.header.1.text.2" : "La versión actual de la herramienta se encuentra en una versión beta pública y se actualizará en función de los comentarios del público.",
	"about.page.sub.header.2.text.1" : "The tool will provide important information for the Justice40 Initiative. The goal of the Justice40 Initiative is to provide 40-percent of the overall benefits of certain federal programs in seven key areas to disadvantaged communities. These seven key areas are: climate change, clean energy and energy efficiency, clean transit, affordable and sustainable housing, training and workforce development, the remediation and reduction of legacy pollution, and the development of critical clean water infrastructure.",
