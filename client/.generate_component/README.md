Creating all the various parts of a React component each time a new component is needed is cumbersome and error-prone.

This folder follows this [link](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-generate-react-components-from-your-terminal-a27741a5b862) to allow the developer to create a new React component (along with sass, tests and barrell) with a single command. The command is 

`npm run gc <NameOfComponent>` 

For example: to create a new React component called MapGeolocate:

`npm run gc MapGeolocate`

Note: gc stands for generate component
