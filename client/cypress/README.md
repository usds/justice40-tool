To debug Cypress tests:

1. In a terminal, run `npm start` to start the site
1. In a separate terminal, run `npm run cy:open` to open cypress with the debug port set to 9222
1. Open a target test from the list
1. Create breakpoints in your test code and/or source
1. Run the `Debug Cypress` command from the debug menu in VSCode
