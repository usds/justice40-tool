    "The Extreme Housing Burden indicator measures the percent of households in a census tract that are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Making less than 80% of the Area Median Family Income as determined by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and\n",
    "2. Paying greater than 50% of their income to housing costs. \n",

This data can be found [here](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/cp.html). \n",
