# Michigan EJ Screen

The Michigan EJ Screen description and publication can be found [here](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/149105/AssessingtheStateofEnvironmentalJusticeinMichigan_344.pdf).


#### Some notes about the input source data:

1. There are two pertinent columns used - `EJ_Score_Cal_Min` and ``Pct_CalMin`.
2. The "Cal" prefix reflects California's methodology omitting racial and ethnic data and the "Min" (please see page 37 - 39 in the above reference) prefix reflects Minnesota's approach to including this data.

The scores and percentile rankings for those columns in the updated sheet are the same as those reflected in the cited report (above), including Appendix I.
