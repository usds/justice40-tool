          ice storm, landslide, riverine flooding, strong wind, tornado, wildfire, and
          winter weather. Population loss is defined as the Spatial Hazard Events and
          Losses and National Centers for Environmental Informationâ€™s (NCEI) reported
          number of fatalities and injuries caused by the hazard occurrence. To combine
          fatalities and injuries for the computation of population loss value, an
          injury is counted as one-tenth (1/10) of a fatality. The NCEI Storm Events
          Database classifies injuries and fatalities as direct or indirect. Both direct
          and indirect injuries and fatalities are counted as population loss. This
          total number of injuries and fatalities is then divided by the population in
          the census tract to get a per-capita rate of population risk."
