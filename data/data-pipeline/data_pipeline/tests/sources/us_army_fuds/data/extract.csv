However, a Tract Register and Audited Real Estate Map of the Pacific Jungle Combat Training Center was\rfound and is the basis for the property information below. \r\rThe property consisted of 2,209.77 acres which included forty-one tracts of land within the Kahana and Punaluu Valleys (Tax Map Key (TMK) 5-2-02 and 5-2-05:various parcels and TMK 5-3-01, 5-3-02, 5-3-04, 5-3-05, 5-3-07 and 5-3-11: various parcels). The Kahana and Punaluu Valleys are now Ahupuaa O Kahana State Park and an agricultural community, respectively.\r\rThe Army acquired 485.25 acres in Kahana Valley by license in November 1944 retroactive to May 1943. In neighboring Punaluu valley, the Army executed leases, licenses, and informal agreements between October 1943 and March 1947, with several instruments retroactive to October 1943, to acquire 1,724.52 acres. The Army established Pacific Jungle Combat Training Center (also known as the Unit Jungle Training Center/Instructors Jungle Training School) on 6 September 1943 for training in basic and advanced jungle warfare. Subjects taught included jungle first aid and evacuation; hand-to-hand combat; construction and passage of wire entanglements; booby traps and demolitions; patrolling and ambushing; hip shooting and infiltration; stream crossing expedients; assault with bayonets; assault of Japanese fortified areas; combat reaction proficiency; and jungle living.\r\rThe Army terminated the licenses for usage of Kahana Valley parcels on 31 August 1946. The Army terminated the leases, licenses.1," and informal permits comprising the various Punaluu Valley parcels beginning in April 1945 and concluding on 30 November 1950. Kahana Valley is presently under the purview of the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources and was set aside as a state park in the 1960s.

Although this 1942 map shows Stovepipe Wells Airport, a later map published in 1944 does not show an airport at Stovepipe Wells. There is no listing for the airport in general aviation directories through 1948. The listing of the airport on a 1942 map and its absence from general airport directories through 1948, suggest that it was an infrequently used dirt strip until 1947, when the Stovepipe Wells Hotel was sold to a Mr. George Putman. Mr. Putman succeeded in constructing two short runways on his property, despite objections from the Director of the Department of the Interior. Since the establishment of Death Valley National Monument in 193 3, the privately owned Stovepipe Wells Hotel has accommodated visitors to the area in competition with Furnace Creek Inn and Ranch, and the airport, for years a dirt landing strip, served to attract visitors who arrived by plane. Stovepipe Wells Airport was privately owned and operated until 1978, when ownership was transferred to the National Park Service," which has since operated the airport. The airport is currently used by the National Park Service and by visitors entering Death Valley National Park at Stovepipe Wells in light planes.\r\n"""," ""USACEDIVISION"": ""spd""}.12","
