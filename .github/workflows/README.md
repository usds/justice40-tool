# Justice40 Github Actions Workflows

This directory has the github actions workflows for the Justice40 Project.

This project is deployed on an AWS account managed by [GeoPlatform.gov](https://www.geoplatform.gov/), and github actions is used to automate the data pipeline and all deployment steps.

The names of the Github Actions stages in the yaml files should describe what each step does, so it is best to refer there to understand the latest of what everything is doing.

To mitigate the risk of having this README quickly become outdated as the project evolves, avoid documenting anything application or data pipeline specific here. Instead, go back up to the [top level project README](/README.md) and refer to the documentation on those components directly.
