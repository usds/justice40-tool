# Justice40 Project Documentation

If you are new to this project, check out the [top level README](/README.md) first.

The content under this directory should be more about conceptually understanding the project, such as [architecture diagrams](architecture), [decision logs](decisions), and the [Open Source Community Orientation](/docs/Justice40_Open_Source_Community_Orientation.pptx), rather than about specific installation steps.

For documentation related to installation and getting set up as a developer or data scientist, see [For Developers and Data Scientists](/README.md#for-developers-and-data-scientists).
